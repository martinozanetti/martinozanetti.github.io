        <p id="LOCATION">
        <b>LOCATION</b><br>
        <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CvWY1zdMBxzKG37r7" target="_blank">Farmhouse "Sepiole di Nani"</a>,
        old farmstead from 1600 at 1420 mslm, surrounded by meadows and woods, reachable from Bagolino by car (partially unpaved 
        consortium road, about 10 parking spaces, to be reserved because we have to report the license plates to the consortium) 
        or on foot for those arriving by public transports at the village (<a href="#HOW TO GET THERE FROM BAGOLINO"> more details here</a>).
        The farmhouse is is tidy and spacious, but not really
        modernised: this means that it can be cold and humid, especially if it rains.</p>

        <p id="WHEN">
        <b>WHEN</b><br>
        From Friday to Sunday. The heart of the festival will be Saturday afternoon and evening, 
        with music and warm dinner in the barn.</p>

        <p id="COMFORT">
        <b>COMFORT</b><br>
        The farmstead has walls, floor and roof. There is a (cold, 8 °C) drinking water fountain. 
        There will be no hot water except for cooking (maaaaybe some for showering). Electricity will be provided by a small generator set 
        mainly for music and main lights, and batteries for secondary lights. Any additional electronic device 
        (mobile phones and headlamps) will hardly be able to be charged (with appropriate plug multipliers, cell 
        phones can be charged when the generator set is running). At the moment, there is no bathroom, but rather a convenient 
        and comfortable two-person latrine.</p>

        <p id="OVERNIGHT STAY">
        <b>OVERNIGHT STAY</b><br>
        There is plenty of room to sleep in the farmhouse: about 20/25 places in a room with windows, 
        more comfortable and less spiffy; about 20 other places in the attic, more quiet but also more spiffy; 
        countless other places in the barn, the coldest and spiffiest room. Some believe that the braves can
        sleep at the ground floor in the stable.
        There is then room for about 15 tents in the surrounding meadow. You'll need to bring everything that is necessary for 
        sleeping (mattress, heavy sleeping bag, pillows, wool socks, hat, earplugs, etc.- <a href="#THINGS TO BRING"> more details here</a>).</p>

        <p id="MEALS">
        <b>MEALS</b><br>
        The organization will think about feeding you with plenty of good food, for which we will ask a total
        contribution of 15€ each (regardless of how long you will stay).
        To drink (apart from fresh good water) about 25 liters of red wine are included, but 
        nothing else: the amounts are too subjective, so we ask you to arrange to bring what you estimate 
        to drink. You will need personal bib, glass and cutlery. Tupperwares are highly recommended to take 
        away possible leftovers.</p>

        <b>HOW TO GET THERE FROM BAGOLINO</b><br>

        <p>
        OPTION 1 - frehsly re-established by Gian and some friends with a lot of dedication!:<br>
        <a href="https://en.mapy.cz/s/cucujabege">Route</a> from Ponte Dasarè, which can only be covered on foot in about 1h.
        There should be space to park about 20 cars close to the starting point of the trail.</p>
        <div class="map-container" style="width:100%; border-width: 5px; border-radius: 2%; border-color: black; border-style: solid;">

        </div>  

        OPTION 2: <br>
        <A href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1Ih2jJTp3NOLx3S6bn3UxFmaI0ATSo5g&hl=en&ehbc=2E312F"> 
        Route from Bagolino </A>, which can be covered by car in about 20 minutes
        (if it is not freezing or too wet), with a pass for the consortium road
        (we will take care of providing an adequate number of passes, at no additional cost to you), 
        or on foot in about 2h30 (arriving in Bagolino by bus or parking the car in the car park where the trail starts). 
        (Opening from the mobile phone, to go to Google Maps click the dotted box in the top right-hand corner).

        <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> this year we will try to leave most of the cars down, which means that we will ask you to most
        preferably go for the OPTION 1 :) </p>
