I am a PhD student at the University of Vienna and I am currently working on electron wavefront shaping with light in free space, using a modified Scanning Electron Microscope. 

Other fields of interest are electronics, laser physics, computer programming and processes automation,
Monte Carlo methods applied to statistical physics and physics of complex systems, environmental
physics and energy supply issues, nuclear fusion.
Since I am a practical person, I usually focus on understanding and using lab technology and I always try to get better with know-how and DIY skills.
