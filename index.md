I am a physicist at the University of Milan and I am currently studying Plasma Physics. I aim to work in the field of superconductors and accelerators physics.

Other fields of interest are electronics, laser physics, computer programming and processes automation,
Monte Carlo methods applied to statistical physics and physics of complex systems, environmental
physics and energy supply issues, nuclear fusion.
Since I am a practical person, during my studies (and life in general) I focused on laboratories and know-how skills training.
