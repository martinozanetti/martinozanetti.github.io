If you want to know more about my experiences not related to professional life, you can go ahead through this post.

  # Sports

I've been practising agonistic Karate from 2005 to 2018 at [Yama Karate Club - Milano](https://www.facebook.com/yamakarateclub). I've been part of the Italian National Team for two years, during which I participated to the [WSKA Championship in Treviso](http://www.wska-karate.org/2017-results/).

Since i was young I practised also some amateur sprts like alpine ski, nordic ski, biking, windsurfing and rock climbing.

  # Mountaineering and high altitude alpinism

  # Music

I began practising drums during elementary school, then i turned to guitar. I attended a musical middle school and continued playing guitar with my best friends at high school.

Between 2009 and 2011 I was part of the [Coro](https://www.laverdi.org/it/coro) delle Voci Bianche of the Synphonic Orchestra of La Verdi; in this context I was a singer in _La Carmen_ representation in Muscat, Oman.
