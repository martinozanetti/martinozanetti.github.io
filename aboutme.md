If you want to know more about my experiences not related to professional life, you can go ahead through this post.

# Association: my role in Circolo Arci Lato B - Milano

I'm an active member of [Lato B](https://www.latobmilano.it/) since 2015. I've been part of the executive committee from january 2019 till october 2021. I'm now responsible for maintenance works and for the theatre shows. Under my leadership the cycle of theatre shows project received a large funding from [Chiesa Valdese](https://www.ottopermillevaldese.org/). I am quite proud of this success.

# Sports

I've been practising agonistic Karate from 2005 to 2018 at [Yama Karate Club - Milano](https://www.facebook.com/yamakarateclub). I've been part of the Italian National Team for two years, during which I participated to the [WSKA World Championship in Treviso](http://www.wska-karate.org/2017-results/). In 2018 I was first in team Kata speciality, in the role of captain.

Since i was young I practise also some amateur sprts like alpine ski, nordic ski, biking, windsurfing and rock climbing.

# Mountaineering and high altitude alpinism

I started mountaneering with my family and cougins when I was young. Around 2014 my brother and I began doing some "soft - alpinism". Some years later he had his first course, and since then our passion for high altitude alpinism exploded. Most of our alpinistic adventures appened in [Parco Nazionale del Gran Paradiso](http://www.pngp.it/), to which we are profoundly attached.

Also through these experiences we developed an unconditional love for animals and wild environments.

# Music

I began practising drums during elementary school, then i turned to guitar. I attended a musical middle school and continued playing guitar with my best friends at high school. With them I developed my passion for Rock music.

Between 2009 and 2011 I was part of the [Coro](https://www.laverdi.org/it/coro) delle Voci Bianche of the Synphonic Orchestra of La Verdi; in this context I was a singer in _La Carmen_ representation in Muscat, Oman.

# Travelling

I really enjoy bike solo travelling. In the years of universuty studies I rode through the North of France and Spain, climbed over the Pyrenees and the Alps from Bozen to Prague. I spent beautiful days in Tuscany, Lazio and Umbria in summer 2021.
[Here](https://martinozanetti.github.io/my_pages/bike-travels/) you can find some pictures and extracts from my "logbooks".

# Gardening

I love gardening and taking care of plants, from big trees to flowers and tropical plants.

# DIY: reuse and repair philosophy; creative attitude
