If you want to know more about my experiences not related to professional life, you can go ahead through this post.

# Association: my role in Circolo Arci Lato B - Milano

I'm an active member of [Lato B](www.latobmilano.it) since 2015. I've been part of the executive committee from january 2019 till october 2021. I'm now responsible for maintenance works and for the theatre shows.

# Sports

I've been practising agonistic Karate from 2005 to 2018 at [Yama Karate Club - Milano](https://www.facebook.com/yamakarateclub). I've been part of the Italian National Team for two years, during which I participated to the [WSKA Championship in Treviso](http://www.wska-karate.org/2017-results/).

Since i was young I practised also some amateur sprts like alpine ski, nordic ski, biking, windsurfing and rock climbing.

# Mountaineering and high altitude alpinism

I started mountaneering with my family and cougins when I was young. Around 2014 my brother and I began doing some "soft - alpinism". Some years later he had his first course, and since then our passion for high altitude alpinism exploded. Most of our alpinistic adventures appened in [Parco Nazionale del Gran Paradiso](http://www.pngp.it/), to which we are profoundly attached.

Also through these experiences we developed an unconditional love for animals and wild environments.

# Music

I began practising drums during elementary school, then i turned to guitar. I attended a musical middle school and continued playing guitar with my best friends at high school. With them I developed my passion for Rock music.

Between 2009 and 2011 I was part of the [Coro](https://www.laverdi.org/it/coro) delle Voci Bianche of the Synphonic Orchestra of La Verdi; in this context I was a singer in _La Carmen_ representation in Muscat, Oman.
